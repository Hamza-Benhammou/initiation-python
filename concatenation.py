# concatenation is used to combine multiple values, for example:

name = "Khabib"
surname = "Nurmagomedov"
full_name = name + " " + surname
print(full_name)

# use + to combine multiple values
# now you can directly print the last variable to display all previous values
# double quotes with space are only here to generate space between name and surname
