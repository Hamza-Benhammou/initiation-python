# if your condition is not correct you can use else for another statement

username = "Daniel"

if username == "Daniel":
    print("Hello, " + username)
else:
    print("Sorry you are not allowed")

# here the condition is true, so the first instruction will be executed
# if it were false, the console would display the message that is in the else statement
